# Cinematics Buddy
Parent repo for all Cinematics Buddy repos. Cinematics Buddy is a tool for Rocket League cinematics artists. It can help with tracking visual effects onto gameplay footage without the headache of trying to use a camera solver. It can also help artists create fully rendered cinematics by reconstructing the animation from the game in an external 3D package, such as 3ds Max.
