Running "UpdateScript.bat" will pull the latest submodule updates, build the plugin, and copy all of the scripts and assets into the root bakkesmod folder. From there, it is easy to package the project for distribution.

If you have recordings from the beta that you still want to convert, you can [get the beta files here](https://github.com/CinderBlocc/CinematicsBuddyBeta).
