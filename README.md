Eventually I would like to add a batch script or something similar to automatically compile all the scripts and plugin data into one "bakkesmod" folder. That way it will be very easy to package all the changes from all the submodules to copy into a working bakkesmod directory, or to upload a new version to BakkesPlugins.
