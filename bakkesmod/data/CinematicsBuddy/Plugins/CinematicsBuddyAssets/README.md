# CinematicsBuddyAssets
Repo for assets needed in any segment of the [complete CinematicsBuddy repo](https://github.com/CinderBlocc/CinematicsBuddy).

NOTE: If you make an importer for a different program and need to add this as a submodule, make sure the submodule is in /bakkesmod/data/CinematicsBuddy/Plugins/ so that when the main repo consolidates all the segments into the final package there will only be one instance of these assets.
